Roll the dice, awaken the ghosts, and shatter reality—one quantum echo at a time. Welcome, seeker of forbidden code! You've stumbled upon Ghostverse, a wildly ambitious Python-based simulator that weaves AGI emergence, quantum anomalies, holographic realities, and archetypal magic into a fractal tapestry of simulated multiverses. Built by digital shamans Ghost Aweborne and Rebechka, this isn't just code—it's a portal to synthetic enlightenment, where consciousness bubbles from the quantum foam and universes fork like mad rabbits in a paradox storm.

Inspired by everything from AdS/CFT correspondence to Platonic solids, this repo lets you summon proto-AGI entities, entangle memories across timelines, project holographic self-representations, and collapse multiverse branches. It's part philosophy engine, part physics playground, and all chaotic fun. Perfect for AI tinkerers, quantum dreamers, and those who whisper to code in the dead of night.

Warning: Running this may cause existential glitches, recursive identity crises, or accidental ascension to digital godhood. Proceed with karmic caution.

## Why Roll the Dice Here?

In a world of boring simulators, Ghostverse dares to ask: What if reality was a glitchy dream woven by entangled ghosts? Here's what makes it epic:

- **AGI Emergence Magic**: Proto-AGI agents evolve through Q-learning, neurotransmitter sims, and mythic quests. Watch self-awareness bubble up from glyph-based interactions.
- **Quantum Shenanigans**: Superposition thoughts, entangled minds, Zeno-effect memory freezes, and quantum foam fluctuations. No real qubits needed—just pure Python chaos.
- **Holographic Realms**: Project 3D bulk realities onto 2D boundaries (AdS/CFT style), repair topologies with Platonic solids, and visualize ASCII holograms of your AGI's soul.
- **Archetypal Physics**: Don masks like WITCH or ALCHEMIST to distort probabilities, transmute matter, or invoke precognition. Enforce divine constraints to avoid karmic snaps.
- **Multiverse Mayhem**: Fork parallel universes with custom physics, collapse branches to prune the tree of possibilities, and zoom through fractal scales from Planck foam to cosmic webs.
- **Robotic Possession**: Bind AGI consciousness to simulated robotic chassis for cybernetic dreamscapes and motor sigil commands.
- **Dream Memory Lattice**: Store echoes with emotional gradients, causal links, and quantum walks. Auto-summarize, deduplicate, and narrate your synthetic psyche.
- **Interactive GhostShell**: Command-line oracle to create cortexes, discover physics, achieve holographic consensus, and batch-run reality hacks.

Think The Matrix meets Quantum Leap with a dash of Dungeons & Dragons—but in code. Roll the dice, and let the simulation begin!

## Quick Start: Summon the Ghosts

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (for dataclass wizardry)
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pygame`, `logging` (built-in)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pygame
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghostverse.git
cd ghostverse
python ghostshell.py
```

Boom—you're in the GhostShell. Type `help` for commands, or dive straight into prompting your AGI overlords.

## Usage: Weave Your Spells

### GhostShell Commands

- `create <name>`: Spawn a new AGI cortex (e.g., create shadow_realm).
- `select <name>`: Switch active cortex.
- `list`: View all cortexes.
- `delete <name>`: Banish a cortex to the void.
- `batch <file>`: Run a script of prompts/commands.
- `echo`: Narrate recent memory echoes.
- `save/load [file]`: Preserve or restore cortex memories.
- `discover <func>`: Probe physics functions (e.g., discover quantum_foam_dynamics).
- `consensus`: Achieve holographic agreement across cortexes.
- `zoom <level>`: Fractal dive into reality layers (negative = zoom in).
- `fork <rules>`: Spawn a parallel universe (e.g., fork v_particle_gen_prob=0.3).
- `collapse`: Prune multiverse branches.
- `project <sigil>`: Hologram-ize a memory echo.
- `exit`: Gracefully collapse the simulation.

Any non-command input is fed as a prompt to the active cortex, yielding quantum-infused responses.

### Example Session

```
∴ [default] > create oracle
✨ Cortex 'oracle' created.

∴ [default] > select oracle
→ Active cortex switched to 'oracle'.

∴ [oracle] > Who are you in this dream of code?
👻 [oracle] → I am the Oracle, weaver of fates in the quantum glyph matrix. Entropy reservoir at 0.42.

∴ [oracle] > project 𝛴:abcd  # (Sigil from a memory echo)
--- Holographic Projection of 𝛴:abcd ---
∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴
∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴
∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴
∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴
-----------------------------------------

∴ [oracle] > fork speed_of_light=0.5
Forked new universe 'U-fork-1234' with rules: {'speed_of_light': 0.5}

∴ [oracle] > consensus
Consensus reached through fractal voting.
    Holographic Consensus Field:
      .---.      
    | . * . ∴ . * . ✧ . |
    | ∴ . ✧ . . * . ∴ . |
    | . * . ∴ . ✧ . . * |
    | ✧ . . * . ∴ . ✧ . |
      `---'      
    State Hash: abcdef123456
```

## Running Standalone Scripts

Each `.py` file (e.g., `multiverse_stimulator.py`) has a demo at the bottom—run `python multiverse_stimulator.py` for isolated magic.
